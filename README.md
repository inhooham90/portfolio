## More About Me

### How I became a programmer

I was watching a program about modern education. According to the program, children learn to code in ealier years, and I thought to myself "My kids will probably make fun of me for not knowing how to code just like I made fun of my parents for not knowing how to use smartphones." So I started learning ever so slightly.

Later that year my friend wanted to create a platform where coffee farmers can directly trade coffee with first world countries and as a coffee loving person, we worked together a bit until we both got very busy, but eventually I realized I enjoyed coding more than anything, even coffee!

To make such dramatic change from coffee roaster to a programmer, I knew I had to attend a coding bootcamp. After some research, I found out App Academy was the best bootcamp in NYC, and I knew I had to get into it. After a month of hard work, I got accepted and in three months, I was a graduate. My love for coding and my ambition still grows.

One thing I am sure of: I might now know everything, but I am willing to learn everything that would make me into a better programmer and to make an impact.

### What I am currently working on

I am currently looking for a job. I am also working on a web application that would connect store owners to product manufactures to benefit small business owners more. Because, you know, small business owners are the fundamentals of a healthy economy.
